        Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and
        writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical
        Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the
        first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is widely regarded as the first to
        recognise the full potential of computers and one of the first computer programmers.
